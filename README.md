# Haskell-CS
Learning Haskell through my CS 2640 class

http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters

for grader's convenience I've labeled the hs files by chapter, unless the tutorial specifies the name of hs file. 

Chapter Files:

InputOutput Folder (ch9)

hoFunctions.hs (ch6)

modules.hs (ch7)

monad.hs (ch12)

monads.hs (ch13)

patternMatch.hs (ch4)

recursion.hs (ch5)

solvePro.hs (ch10)

types.hs (ch8) 

zipper.hs (ch14)

**chapter files are for the numerous functions i executed, ch 1 2 3 and 11 were short and didnt have much functions other than the separate executable files.
**all other files are from the various chapters which the tutorial specifies to make to execute separately.
