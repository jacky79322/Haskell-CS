# Haskell-CS
Learning Haskell through my CS 2640 class

http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters

for grader's convenience I've labeled the hs files by chapter, unless the tutorial specifies the name of hs file. 

Chapter Files:

InputOutput Folder

hoFunctions.hs

modules.hs

monad.hs

monads.hs

patternMatch.hs

recursion.hs

solvePro.hs

types.hs

zipper.hs


**all other files are from the various chapters which the tutorial specifies to make to execute separately.
